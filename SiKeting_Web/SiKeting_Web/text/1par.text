01 introduction
With the global development of electronic music, the profession of VJ, which complements DJs in enhancing the live atmosphere, has gained considerable attention. VJs use visual imagery to interpret changes in DJ rhythm, music ambiance, and themes. Europe and the United States already boast highly skilled VJs and dedicated studios. However, contrary to the popularity of VJs abroad, the term "VJ" is not widely recognized in China and is still in its infancy.
As one interested in the field of audio-visual interaction, I began learning to use Processing for audio-visual interactive creation in China in early 2022. Surprisingly, I first heard the term "VJ" after coming to France. Despite living in China for 23 years, with five years spent in Shanghai, a region known for its thriving electronic music scene, I had never encountered the term before. The discovery came during my research on the history of audio-visual interaction, where I stumbled upon the term "VJ" in academic papers. On October 22, I attended the Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF), where the live electronic music, VJ visuals, and lighting created an enthralling experience, leaving me with unforgettable memories.
As my understanding of VJ deepened step by step, I began to explore the current development of VJs in China, selecting the study of Chinese VJs as the topic for my graduate thesis in École supérieure d'art et design de Saint-Étienne. The research objectives of this paper are outlined as follows:
This study aims to investigate the definition of VJ in China and its specific characteristics within a particular context, particularly within the unique cultural and social environment of China. The research seeks to explore the current development status of VJ in the context of nightclubs and electronic music. Despite the considerable attention given to new media design in China, many artists and designers engaged in audio-visual interactive works showcased in museums often do not identify themselves as VJs. VJ appears to be a somewhat marginalized profession.
Moreover, there is a notable lack of research on VJ in China, especially within the distinctive cultural context where nightclubs are often perceived as venues associated with adult content or disorder. Additionally, the approval challenges and venue restrictions faced by the electronic music festivals contribute to a limited understanding of the VJ profession in China. Therefore, this study aims to uncover the practical realities of VJ in China within this unique context. Through an in-depth analysis of the definition and development of VJ, the research seeks to provide a more accurate framework for understanding this field.
The thesis consists of three parts. Chapter One introduces the definition of VJ, tracing its historical development, examining the scale and distribution of VJ professionals, and exploring the widely used technologies in the industry, encompassing both software and hardware tools. Chapter Two focuses on VJs in Chinese nightclubs and music festivals, investigating their educational background, working hours, salary arrangements, and the challenges faced by the development of VJ culture in China. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying reasons for these challenges, I aim to reveal the current status of VJs within the context of Chinese club culture and music festival scenes, providing insights into future development trends. Chapter Three undertakes a comparative study of audio-visual performance artists, with a particular emphasis on the distinctions and similarities among nightclub VJs, music festival VJs, and interactive audio-visual artists in terms of their working environments, educational backgrounds, visual effects, and the relationship between music and visuals.
It's important to note that the information in this paper primarily stems from interviews with five Chinese VJs, each possessing industry experience ranging from 5 to 12 years. All interviews were conducted online. Given the lack of reference literature describing VJs in China, textual references were drawn from the Chinese online Q&A community "Zhihu." Additionally, I consulted introductory videos on the VJ from domestic sources, with video content originating from the Chinese video platform "Bilibili."
