04 Audio-Visual Performance Artists & Comparison
Audio-Visual Performance
Conceptually, audio visualization performances belong to the category of audio visualization interaction, which currently belongs to the field of digital media design in China[Fig.4-1]. With the continuous development of new media, the widespread use of projection equipment and large screens has made designers no longer limited to the traditional design medium. To expand the ways of sensory experiences, designers integrate visual and auditory elements. This concept has gradually driven the progress of the audio visualization performances.(A summary based on the author's observations of digital media design in China)
In terms of content, the most significant distinction between audio-visual interactive artists and conventional VJs lies in their emphasis on storytelling, profound thoughts, and expressive capabilities. Their works go beyond simple combinations of images and sounds; they represent a meaningful and profound artistic expression.
Also, not all artists put money as a priority and don't want to be characterized and limited by commercial and market considerations. These artists aspire to have a leading role in their creative endeavors, and are more focused on expressing their own ideas and content.
Development
Tracing the development of audiovisual interactive art in China, according to the "Audiovisual Art White Paper'' released by the School of Art Design and Media Department of East China University of Technology on November 29, 2023: "With the hosting of major international events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, along with advancements in network and computer technologies, audiovisual interactive art has rapidly emerged in China. Initially, in the Shanghai region[...]especially around 2010, when the Shanghai International Electronic Music Competition witnessed the emergence of audiovisual art. In 2015, the Ofopen Creative Coding Competition, jointly organized by Tsinghua University's Academy of Arts & Design[...] and Parsons School of Design in the United States, promoted the application of creative coding techniques in universities."
Development Factors
• Software Tools:
Based on personal observations, Chinese students predominantly utilize Touch Designer and Processing when creating audiovisual interactive works. Professor Zhang Yinan introduced Touch Designer to Tongji University between 2011 and 2012, organizing workshops with the company over approximately a week's duration. The establishment of the TEA Chinese education community* in 2019 contributed significantly to the widespread use of Touch Designer, providing substantial impetus to audiovisual interactive performances.
• Art Forms:
In terms of artistic exploration, the forms of new media art and installations abroad have sparked significant interest among Chinese artists. Some artists began experimenting with these forms around 2008, with a second and third wave of exploration occurring around 2012-2013. This suggests a gradual increase in the recognition of domestic artists towards new media and interactive art forms.
• Universities Specialization:
Universities are progressively establishing programs related to audiovisual interaction*. Terms such as "cross-media design" and "audiovisual design" are being introduced, incorporating the fusion of music and visual elements into the exploration domain. Major art academies in China are initiating specialized programs. As expressed by TonyMark, “Around 2015, these programs began to emerge gradually. Schools like Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts had new media courses as early as the 2000s, but they were not given sufficient attention at the time. However, post 2018, these programs started to enroll large numbers of students, indicating a growing demand for expertise in this field, with students increasingly showing interest.”
Artists
•Wang Meng + Yu Miao [Fig.4-2]Social media: https://www.youtube.com/@miaoyu9594/featured & https://space.bilibili.com/85447149
Wang Meng handles the visual elements, while Yu Miao is responsible for the music. Yu Miao primarily performs using the traditional Chinese instrument, the Guzheng, exploring unconventional playing techniques to discover new possibilities.What sets these two apart from many other Chinese artists is their innovative approach, breaking away from directly replicating old traditional visuals and music.
Elements used[Fig4-3 - Fig4-8]
Wang Meng's visual style is typically 3D, incorporating elements such as ancient Chinese architecture, flowing water, and crowds. The scenes crafted by Wang Meng often feature grand Chinese-style backgrounds but with fantastical and wildest narratives. For example, the screenshots in the provided link showcase people swimming in the air or buildings growing legs and walking.
Performance Place[Fig4-9 - Fig4-14]
In addition to regular performance spaces, they also perform in caves and grottoes. Leveraging their 3D visual style, projections onto irregular stone surfaces add depth to the visuals. The cave structures enhance the music with multi-layered echoes. The provided link includes images of projections on stone walls in a valley in Qingdao, as well as performances in the Zunyi Shuanghe Cave.
•Guan Boyang[Fig.4-15]
Guan Boyang's profile links: https://www.youtube.com/@boyangguan114、https://space.bilibili.com/37578604、https://guanboyang.bandcamp.com/album/guan-the-immortal-tide
Guan Boyang possesses strong technical and expressive abilities in music production. As an artist, he often integrates his thoughts into his work. His latest album explores the relationship between the online world and life. He describes it as, "Blending suitable styles like IDM, Techno, Ambient, etc., through synthesizer modulation and wild sample processing, I construct a seemingly parallel yet incredibly real otherworldly landscape. I insert a pair of virtual alter egos into this world to advance the plot."
In November 2023, he presented a solo live music and visual performance titled "CROTALUS 360"[Fig4-16 - Fig4-23]. According to his description below the video, the entire performance is an audiovisual instrument & sound-image isomorphic real-time show, facilitated by a digital instrument with only three tracks. Real-time scanning of images produces waveforms (wavetables), and the entire 360-degree circular screen serves as a sequencer and sound distorter. The sounds generated from images are irregular and texturally distinct, presenting pure and aggressively digital noise, accompanied by structurally complex polyrhythmic sequences, earning it the name "CROTALUS."
•Wang Changcun[Fig.4-24]
Wang Changcun (AYRTBH), a sound artist, electronic music composer, computer musician, and software/network art creator. Profile links: https://changcun.wang/、https://space.bilibili.com/626179959、https://www.instagram.com/ayrtbh/
Wang Changcun is one of the earliest explorers in the field of experimental electronic music and computer-programmed composition in China. His long-term artistic practice is closely related to non-traditional art languages such as digital, network, and algorithm, often reflecting the dilemma of people's movement in established spaces through virtual structures.
Wang Changcun's visual design, as described on his personal website, appears to collect images commonly seen in the online world, transforming them into a new visual format presented to the audience[Fig4-25 - Fig4-33].
•GOOOOOSE[Fig.4-34]
Profile links: https://www.instagram.com/hanhan_gooooose/ 、https://www.annexagency.co.uk/gooooose
GOOOOOSE is Han Han. His multi-instrumental approach of making music usually leads the audience into a place where ambient soundscape, heavily synthesized texture and syncopated rhythms find their harmony, yet still fighting with each other sometimes. Apart from making music, Han Han is also a visual artist and software developer, also frontman of one of China’s electronica bands - Duck Fight Goose and owner of Miniless Recordings.
His work "Voxels — A Research of the 21st Century Species[Fig4-35 - Fig4-38]", performed by him in November 2023 at offscript x UFO Terminal at TankShanghai, serves as a visual extension of his album "Rudiments." In the process, a cluster of metallic-glossed lines intertwines, resembling a lifelike entity that pulsates with the rhythm of the music, almost as if it breathes.
Existing Issues:
• Limited Art Themes:
Society often fails to fully appreciate, and sometimes even disregards, the normal demand for art. Artists often find themselves restricted to themes that are surface-level and avoid social pain points, constraining true creative expression. Especially post-pandemic, the highly regarded theme of "healing" in China has not triggered profound societal reflections but has evolved into a means to soothe emotions.(Doing art against the government in China will risk prison.)
• Insufficient Financial Support:
Domestically, there is inadequate support for artists, lacking dedicated mechanisms to provide funding and subsidies. Jimmz: "Actually, every year, organizing performances or exhibitions for the Light Art Festival(A digital media art festival organized by TEA) involves a financial investment. A significant portion of the funds from our other commercial projects is allocated to this."
• Lack of Social Status:
Artists lack sufficient recognition in society, with many viewing those studying design and art as symbols of poor academic performance or idleness, rather than individuals making career choices based on their interests.
• Bias in Employment Choices:
Even graduates from design and art colleges rarely enter the new media art industry. Employment decisions predominantly depend on salary and alignment with mainstream values, diminishing the importance of individual interests. This constrains exploration and support for more experimental and innovative fields of art.
Comparison
The summary table I have compiled provides a general overview of industry practitioners, without delving into individual cases.
Besides, in terms of real-time and improvisational aspects of VJ performances, nightclub VJs typically leverage pre-prepared visual elements, utilizing Resolume to make on-the-spot adjustments such as rotation, speed modulation, and distortion to synchronize with the musical performance of the DJ, demonstrating a degree of improvisation. In the context of music festivals, VJs, driven by considerations for stability and minimizing errors, often opt to play prepared materials, with seldom manifestations of real-time adjustments.
Within the artist community, some artists choose to directly play prepared materials to maintain a distinctive personal style. In contrast, other artists, such as Guan Boyang, adopt a production method that involves direct generation based on live sound, constituting live generation.
