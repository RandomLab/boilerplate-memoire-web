05 Conclusion
This study provides an exploration of the current state of VJ development in China. Through chapters on nightclub VJs, festival VJs, and music visualization artists, it reveals that the development of VJ culture in China is still in its early stages. Despite certain issues such as emulation of popular foreign visual styles, a lack of individual reflection and innovation, and insufficient attention to copyright concerns, the future growth of VJ appears promising.
In the process of development, the VJ industry in China faces various challenges, including government restrictions, lagging education levels, and students' preferences in employment choices. In order to promote the better development of VJ, emphasis should be placed on the development of software and aesthetic education. Furthermore, VJs can seek international opportunities to foster exchange and learning.
While it may be challenging to alter governmental decisions, individuals can continuously enhance their personal skills and innovation capabilities, contributing to the advancement of their own development.
Beyond exploring the VJ profession, this study also intends to broaden the understanding of the future development direction of new media design in China. As a student in the field of media communication design, navigating the uncertainties of future career development is a profound challenge. Thus, by immersing myself in VJ research, I hope to gain a deeper practical understanding of media communication design and identify potential directions for my future works. Simultaneously, this research serves as a reference for fellow students who may be grappling with uncertainty about their future career paths.
