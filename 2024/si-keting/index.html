            With the global development of electronic music, the profession of VJ, which complements DJs in enhancing the live atmosphere, has gained considerable attention. VJs use visual imagery to interpret changes in DJ rhythm, music ambiance, and themes. Europe and the United States already boast highly skilled VJs and dedicated studios. However, contrary to the popularity of VJs abroad, the term "VJ" is not widely recognized in China and is still in its infancy.
        <br>
            As one interested in the field of audio-visual interaction, I began learning to use Processing for audio-visual interactive creation in China in early 2022. Surprisingly, I first heard the term "VJ" after coming to France. Despite living in China for 23 years, with five years spent in Shanghai, a region known for its thriving electronic music scene, I had never encountered the term before. The discovery came during my research on the history of audio-visual interaction, where I stumbled upon the term "VJ" in academic papers. On October 22, I attended the Amsterdam Music Festival (AMF), where the live electronic music, VJ visuals, and lighting created an enthralling experience, leaving me with unforgettable memories.
        <br>
            As my understanding of VJ deepened step by step, I began to explore the current development of VJs in China, selecting the study of Chinese VJs as the topic for my graduate thesis in École supérieure d'art et design de Saint-Étienne. The research objectives of this paper are outlined as follows:
        <br>
            This study aims to investigate the definition of VJ in China and its specific characteristics within a particular context, particularly within the unique cultural and social environment of China. The research seeks to explore the current development status of VJ in the context of nightclubs and electronic music. Despite the considerable attention given to new media design in China, many artists and designers engaged in audio-visual interactive works showcased in museums often do not identify themselves as VJs. VJ appears to be a somewhat marginalized profession.
        <br>
            Moreover, there is a notable lack of research on VJ in China, especially within the distinctive cultural context where nightclubs are often perceived as venues associated with adult content or disorder. Additionally, the approval challenges and venue restrictions faced by the electronic music festivals contribute to a limited understanding of the VJ profession in China. Therefore, this study aims to uncover the practical realities of VJ in China within this unique context. Through an in-depth analysis of the definition and development of VJ, the research seeks to provide a more accurate framework for understanding this field.
        <br>
            The thesis consists of three parts. Chapter One introduces the definition of VJ, tracing its historical development, examining the scale and distribution of VJ professionals, and exploring the widely used technologies in the industry, encompassing both software and hardware tools. Chapter Two focuses on VJs in Chinese nightclubs and music festivals, investigating their educational background, working hours, salary arrangements, and the challenges faced by the development of VJ culture in China. Through a detailed analysis of the underlying reasons for these challenges, I aim to reveal the current status of VJs within the context of Chinese club culture and music festival scenes, providing insights into future development trends. Chapter Three undertakes a comparative study of audio-visual performance artists, with a particular emphasis on the distinctions and similarities among nightclub VJs, music festival VJs, and interactive audio-visual artists in terms of their working environments, educational backgrounds, visual effects, and the relationship between music and visuals.
        <br>It's important to note that the information in this paper primarily stems from interviews with five Chinese VJs, each possessing industry experience ranging from 5 to 12 years. All interviews were conducted online. Given the lack of reference literature describing VJs in China, textual references were drawn from the Chinese online Q&A community "Zhihu." Additionally, I consulted introductory videos on the VJ from domestic sources, with video content originating from the Chinese video platform "Bilibili."

                    <b>Concept of VJing:</b>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    VJ, short for Visual Jockey, is a profession that typically collaborates with DJs. While the DJ is responsible for mixing and playing music, the VJ focuses on the visual aspect, skillfully coordinating with the DJ to enhance the musical atmosphere. Their objective is to create a synchronized visual experience that complements the music, enriching the overall ambiance for the audience.
        <br>
                    Additionally, Merrill Aldighieri, the first artist to use the term "Visual Jockey," defines it as video performers who "create an improvised live video feed to interpret the DJ's music." This term describes a performer in the club setting (Furs, 2023).
        <br>
                    Based on interviews and literature review, I have summarized that VJing can be categorized into three types, with the first two being commercial activities and the third primarily serving non-commercial purposes:
        <br>
                    a. Providing visual accompaniment for DJs in clubs, aiming to enhance the on-site atmosphere, often pursued as an individual profession;
        <br>
                    b. Coordinating VJing with live music in large-scale commercial events (such as opening ceremonies, press conferences, electronic music festivals), typically operated as a team;
        <br>c. Artists specializing in audio-visual performance, distinguished by a relatively lower commercial focus, and emphasizing storytelling, artistic expression, and emotional communication in their creative endeavors. For most artists, VJing is considered a behavior, a tool, or a means of creation rather than a direct form of artistic content.

                    <strong>Development History</strong>
                    <br>
                    Currently, VJing in China is still in its early stages, and it is challenging to trace the exact beginnings of VJing in the country. However, we can review the history of nightclubs. The development of nightclubs in China began in the late 20th century, during the 1970s and 1980s, coinciding with the tail end of the international disco music trend.

                    Foreign disco culture flowed into China, and dance halls became popular venues for dancing and socializing.

                    At that time, there was no one manipulating video playback, but there were vibrant and dazzling lights. VJ Tom mentioned, “The emergence of VJs should be around the late 1990s. Previously, at places like

                    </span>
                    , they didn't have specific performances. I think VJing started when performances became a thing. It wasn't until later, with the advent of electronic music, that they began performing with electronic dance music.”


        <br>
                    The history of VJing in China can be traced back to the emergence of video art or MTV. The rise of video art, facilitated by the widespread availability of televisions,provided a visual form for the public. The introduction of MTV directly combined music and visuals, laying the foundation for the integration of music and visual arts.

                    <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="* This is directly related to the political situation. After the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a nationwide famine occurred from 1958 to 1962, resulting in the death of millions of people. From May 1966 to October 1976, Mao Zedong launched the 'Cultural Revolution', during which absurdities such as the inversion of values and intellectuals being sent to rural areas for farming took place. It wasn't until the opening of reforms in December 1978, with the introduction of foreign ideologies, that an environment conducive to the development of the arts was established.">
                        <span class="highlight">"However, unlike the development of Western visual arts history, China did not go through the phases of video art since the 1960s, experimental films in the 1970s, and the prevalent MTV culture of the 1980s in the West"*. </span>
                    </span>
                    (Guo, X, 2011). “The earliest practitioner of video art in China, Zhang Peili, completed his first video work, '30 × 30'
        , in 1988, which was publicly displayed at the 'China Modern Art Exhibition' in 1989, marking the first video artwork in mainland China.” (Jiang, X, 2014).

                    “MTV, as a new art form, entered China in the 1990s. Starting in 1993, the continuous hosting of the China Music Television Awards by China Central Television greatly promoted the vigorous development and maturity of MTV in China” (Cheng, H, 2007). “The first domestic MV in China was the classic children's song 'Little Snail Horn'.

                    It is performed by Cheng Lin in 1985, and filmed by Beijing Television.” (Wikipedia). However, there is insufficient evidence to directly correlate the emergence of VJing in China with the development of video art and MTV.
        <br>
                    Following this historical period, I have summarized several reasons for the emergence of VJ culture in China:
        <br>
                    • The vigorous development of LED product technology and its application from 2003 to 2007 provided extensive opportunities for large-screen technology, creating a thriving market and facilitating the widespread application of large-screen technology in various fields.
        <br>
                    • Inspired by foreign experiences, the operational model of domestic nightclubs actively incorporated the profession of VJ, making visual presentation an integral part of nightclub management.
        <br>
                    • The phenomenon of foreign DJs bringing their own VJ performance teams to international electronic music festivals prompted domestic clubs to seriously consider how to enhance competitiveness through visual forms, surpassing the current reliance on music and lighting alone.
        <br>
                    • Some overseas Chinese entrepreneurs, having accumulated experience in foreign clubs and electronic music festivals, returned to China to start their businesses. During the initial stages of entrepreneurship, they directly considered the VJ profession, gradually establishing this industry in the country.
        <br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>Number</strong>
                    <br>
                    Through rough estimation, the number of VJs in nightclubs, bars, music festivals, and electronic music festivals across China is projected to be between 9,000 and 10,000 individuals. VJ Tom stated, “I can make an estimate: I think it should be around 9,000 to 10,000. Because I calculated it, considering my social circle, including TikTok, Bilibili, and other video platforms, adding up all my followers, currently, it's just over 10,000. Then, in the Resolume CN_VJ group, where only talented individuals can join, there are over 300.
        [...] If we talk specifically about electronic music festivals, there should be a total of around 3,000 VJs.”


                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/9-27.webp"/>
                        <figcaption>During the interview with VJ Tom, he showed me a WeChat group chat named “Resolute CN_VJ”, which contains 318 VJs. According to him, all members in the group are skilled and experienced VJs.

                    <br>
                    <strong>Distribution</strong>
                    <br>
                    The distribution of VJs is closely tied to the distribution of clubs and the development of electronic music. VJing in clubs is predominantly concentrated in major cities such as Beijing, Chengdu, Shanghai, and Guangzhou.

            I have highlighted Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Guangzhou on the original map.

                    Creep : “ It would be beneficial to explore VJs in places other than Shanghai, such as Guangzhou, Beijing, and Chengdu, where many large clubs exist. Shanghai is too capital-centric; VJs can earn money, but creative freedom is not guaranteed.” Due to its proximity to Hong Kong, the Guangdong region has seen better development in VJing with the influx of electronic music and external culture, making the southern part of China more prosperous than the northern part. VJ Tom: “There are more VJs in the Guangdong region because people here have more exposure to electronic music. [...] In the southern part, there are indeed more than in the northern part. Many DJs and VJs in the north come from the south, probably because they have more exposure to electronic music.”
        <br>
                    The uneven economic development in China, characterized by a mix of pre-modern, modern, and post-modern conditions, results in a stark contrast between club culture in first-tier cities and small towns. Taking my hometown Zhengzhou, the provincial capital of Henan, as an example, a large nightclub called Mexx in the city center, featured a stage and VJ performances, with charges based on seating arrangements ranging from 198 to 600 yuan(≈ 25-77 euros)

                    The work of a VJ can be divided into two main components: software operation and hardware usage.
        <br>
                    “In terms of software, VJs employ a variety of tools such as Resolume, Arkaos, Modul 8, VDMX, VisualJockey SP1, TouchDesigner, Max/MSP Jitter, Pure Data, VVVV, Processing, OpenFramework.” (VJ Elephant, 2020). Additionally, VJs may use post-production software for animation and editing, such as Premiere (Pr) and After Effects (Ae), and modeling software like Cinema 4D (C4D). The primary software choice varies among individual VJs. For instance, in interviews, Keefer mentioned using Unreal, Jimmz prefers Touch Designer, and TonyMark utilizes VVVV and Resolume.
        <br>
                    “In terms of hardware, VJs utilize a diverse range of equipment, including Wii controllers, Xbox gamepads, flight joysticks, foot pedals, standard 25-key MIDI keyboards (e.g., M-AUDIO Oxygen 25), standard MIDI controllers (e.g., APC40), standard DJ MIDI controllers (e.g., Pioneer DDJ-SR), iPads, iPod touches, Kinect, and more.” (VJ Elephant, 2017).
        <br>
                    VJ Tom: “After I started working with front-end devices in 2019, I began learning software in the following two years. This involved studying playback control software, post-production software, and other aspects like processors and servers. To simplify, everything a VJ does can be condensed from control to computer, computer to video processors, video switchers, and then connecting to screens.”

            The video processor handles signal processing, resolution conversion, grayscale control, color management, and multi-screen display. To facilitate signal transmission, the sending card is positioned at the output of the video processor, responsible for converting the processed signal into a format recognizable by the LED screen. It then transmits the signal to the receiving card on the LED screen via transmission lines.

                        <b>Club VJ:</b>
                        <br>
                        <br>In clubs, VJs are professionals who collaborate with DJs and lighting technicians to enhance the atmosphere of the venue. Typically individual practitioners, their performances are live and spontaneous, as VJs may not know what music the DJ will play. In the current nightclub culture in China, there is relatively low emphasis on visuals, with clubs relying on lighting technicians and DJs to create the atmosphere. Despite numerous DJ and lighting training programs in the country, there is a lack of dedicated training for VJs. Aspiring VJs often need to find mentors in nightclubs for apprenticeship, as club owners may have lower aesthetic expectations and less specific requirements for VJ content, leading to some VJs choosing to present similar or repetitive material on a daily basis.

                        <strong>Educational Background</strong>
                        <br>
                        Currently, individuals engaging in VJing in China typically undergo training through an apprenticeship system, where experienced practitioners within clubs personally impart their skills.

                        <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="* Although the Chinese government has consistently strengthened regulations and enforcement efforts for the protection of intellectual property rights, challenges persist in enforcement. At times, legal execution may lack the necessary stringency, resulting in difficulties effectively combatting acts of infringement. China's cultural industry is relatively nascent, and the development of awareness and mechanisms for copyright protection may be somewhat lagging. The establishment of robust regulations and business practices in this domain might necessitate additional time. ">
                            <span class="highlight">The entire training system primarily revolves around imitation of preferred works, representing a form of mimicry. Often, they directly download materials from the internet for playback, lacking consideration and reflection on fundamental design issues*.  </span>
                        </span>
                        Creep : “ Initially in China, VJing followed an apprenticeship model, with apprentices learning under experienced individuals within nightclubs. As of 2021, many still use pirated software like Resolume. Their entire system is based on imitation, a 'take it and use it' approach, without delving into the foundational questions of 'how,' 'what,' and 'why.' ”
          <br>
                        Due to the generally low cultural literacy of practitioners and the scarcity of training in arts and design, aesthetic concepts have persisted for years without a profound understanding of design. TonyMark: “The awareness of nightclub VJs in China is insufficient because many VJs only have education backgrounds ranging from high school to college, and even college graduates are rare.” Jimmz: “Speaking of educational levels, European cultural and educational standards are undoubtedly higher. Therefore, the aesthetic foundation is quite different. The aesthetic foundation in China is perhaps more varied, and European VJs, with a better aesthetic foundation, create with a different artistic height in mind.”

                        The following information is sourced from the video blogger “Uncle TUTU”, who, starting as a VJ from scratch and later managing a nightclub, provided insights into VJ salaries and working hours in his Bilibili video on February 15, 2021 :

                        Monthly salary of 15,000 RMB (≈1959 euros), responsible for the main stage at 23:00, typically an experienced professional who understands music structure. If they create their own materials, the monthly salary may be higher than 15,000 RMB.

          <br>
                        However, the above data is for reference only, as the domestic COVID-19 situation in China has greatly impacted the nightclub economy. Currently, nightclubs in China are undergoing staff reductions for VJs, leading to a situation where VJ skills and salaries are quite chaotic. VJ Tom: “Salaries depend on the level because there are different levels, some earning 20,000 RMB(≈2613 euros), and others earning 6,000 RMB(≈777 euros). Today, I just met a VJ from a club in Hefei. He doesn't have many works or a portfolio. He jumped from a salary of 8,000 RMB(≈1045 euros) to 12,000 RMB(≈1567 euros), and then from 12,000 RMB to 20,000 RMB in just over a year. It's quite chaotic. [...] The number of VJs in a nightclub used to be around 4 people, but now it's down to 2 in some cases, and even 1 in others. Due to the current unfavorable environment, staff reductions have taken place.”

                        <br>
                        <strong>Existing Issues</strong>
                        <br>
                        • Lack of creative concepts and aesthetics:
          <br>
                        The unique nature of the nightclub economy poses significant challenges for those involved in design and artistry on a commercial level. VJs’ responsibilities are often qualitatively defined as creating an atmosphere in the club, aiming to ignite the audience's enthusiasm and ensure a vibrant club ambiance. As a result, they lack a means of self-expression. TonyMark: “To put it plainly, nightclubs don't need VJs to express too much. Nightclubs only require VJs to play the most exciting content. Even in high-level nightclubs, VJs primarily focus on pleasing the audience, emphasizing the popular and local style.”
          <br>
                        • Lack of copyright awareness:
          <br>
                        The use of pirated software may be related to cost considerations, as software tends to be relatively expensive. Some nightclubs may opt for pirated software due to economic considerations.Keefer: “Many nightclubs in China have been using pirated software that hasn't been updated for years, resulting in outdated functionalities. They still rely on downloading materials from websites, with, at most, some animations created for the club's logo.”

                        <strong>Causes of the Issues</strong>
                        <br>
                        • Chinese education system:
          <br>
                        Based on my own experience and observations, students need to exert significant effort to pass exams and secure a place in a good university. They invest a substantial amount of effort and cost to obtain quality education, to the extent that after graduation, they are not inclined to choose a profession like nightclub VJing, which offers low pay, poor treatment, disrupted sleep patterns, and lack of recognition. Their baseline expectations for employment have been elevated due to the high cost of education, and they hope that their advanced degrees will bring substantial returns. Creep : “Artists coming out of art schools are particularly lazy. They don't want to spend every night in the club working as a VJ; they want to engage in free creation, so they establish studios. ”

                        • Fresh Visual Styles
          <br>
                        The nightclub industry is currently undergoing a wave of reflection on aesthetics and system operations. With an increasing number of international DJs performing in Chinese clubs, it has become common for them to bring their own VJing teams. This cross-cultural exchange has prompted a stronger reflection on aesthetics and system operations within domestic club VJing, forcing them to break away from rigid past models. Creep : “Even large domestic clubs are exploring new things and understanding the content and knowledge behind them. For example, starting in 2019, the entire industry began to embrace styles like 3D and cyber

                                Keefer and Creep expressed similar views: "The future trend for VJs may lean towards cyberpunk and 3D styles, fueled by the popularity of Afterlife." The image is a photograph taken during an Afterlife performance, sourced from Pinterest at the following URL:
              <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/749638300500207491/">https://www.pinterest.com/pin/749638300500207491/</a>

                                Afterlife is based in Berlin, established in 2016. The VJ style employed by Afterlife leans towards the use of cybernetic elements. What captivates the audience is the cybernetic figures synchronized with the music, showcasing dynamic movements and gestures. For instance, overlooking the crowd and striking the screens, creating a powerful and immersive experience during live performances.

                        Domestically, they would first study how to create these things and then supplement their aesthetic and design knowledge. I think this is progress. ”
          <br>
                        • Educational Enhancement
          <br>In addition, as more experienced VJs enter the field of education, the entire industry will continue to improve, but it will take time. TonyMark: “In terms of trends, in my opinion, it will take another 5 to 10 years to cultivate talent. Currently, there is a severe lack of good VJs, and the design education level of this group of people needs to be elevated for improvement to be possible.”

                            <br>VJs in music festivals differ significantly from those in nightclubs in terms of visual presentation. Within China, large-scale commercial music festivals such as the Strawberry Music Festival, the MIDI Music Festival, the Modern Music Festival, and the Maitian Music Festival invite pop singers, bands, and rock musicians for performances. Audiences attending these music festivals primarily seek to enjoy the performances of their favorite artists. In large music festivals, the role of VJs is primarily to highlight the artists, serving as a background element. Additionally, some bands have their own VJs, contributing visually stunning effects that are meticulously rehearsed and aligned with the band's overarching vision. Moverover, VJs at electronic music festivals differ in visual presentation from those at large-scale commercial music festivals, they enjoy relatively more creative freedom.

          <br>
                        a. Venue-Provided VJs
          <br>
                        TonyMark mentions, “If you want a good VJ, it can be quite expensive. However, to cut costs,



                        <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="* It is the current situation in China where VJs and electronic screens are bundled for music festivals. The entity that rents (or provides) the electronic screens also offers VJs, and they are bundled together as a service for the festival organizers. This way, organizers do not have to spend additional money to hire a separate VJ. During the research, the interviewee Tom initially worked on the installation of electronic screens, but later, through his own efforts, transitioned to become a VJ. In general, there is a connection between electronic screens and VJs.">
                            <span class="highlight">organizers often directly use those who provide LED screens for the music festival venue*.  </span>
                        </span>
                        These VJs are associated with the current trend at many music festivals, where cost-effectiveness is a primary consideration.” Their main responsibility is to deliver basic visual effects that align with the overall requirements of the music festival. They typically do not have the flexibility for on-the-spot creativity and primarily broadcast images of artists directly captured by cameras. VJ-Tom adds, “Nowadays, it's mostly two big screens with portraits hanging there, and the lyrics are usually displayed. The visuals depend on the venue, as stability is the priority.”
          <br>
                        b. Market-Found VJs
          <br>
                        Organizers search for VJs based on the theme or overall style of the music festival. These VJs maintain a certain personal style in their creations while customizing their work according to the organizers' expectations. This approach showcases both the VJ's individual creativity and professional expertise, meeting the organizers' requirements for the overall visual effects.
          <br>
                        c. Band's own VJ
          <br>
                        Band's own VJ is characterized by its relative stability and high degree of freedom, which provides the VJ with greater room for progress and opportunities for rapid improvement. In terms of visual presentation, each performance showcases unique visuals that undergo improvement and enhancement while retaining distinctive visual features. Take, for example, the band “The Right to Reshape Statues”.

                        VJ-Tom states, “If a band has its own VJ, there are fewer limitations. Do you know a band called The Right to Reshape Statues? Their VJ has no limitations, and they can play different effects on a simple screen. It's all about using their imagination. They progress with every performance, doing quite well.”

                        • Electronic music festivals
          <br>
                        VJs at electronic music festivals enjoy relatively more creative freedom, with fewer thematic restrictions. Most well-known electronic music festivals in China are imported from abroad, such as VAC China, EDC China, Ultra China, Creamfields, and more.

                        As an example, taking the recent Strawberry Music Festival held in Guangzhou, China (November 18-19, 2023), this showcases the visual content classification of large-scale commercial music festivals. The Strawberry Music Festival is one of the largest music festivals in China, established in 2009 by Modern Sky, the largest independent record company in mainland China.(Wikipedia) The visuals displayed by VJs at the Strawberry Music Festival are somewhat representative.

          <br>
                        TonyMark: “In China, the majority prefer direct shots of portraits, broadcasting them live. While this is not bad because the audience wants to see the singers, besides that, if you explore more, you'll find that a significant percentage, for example, around 30%, involves direct shots of people with a bit of additional material layered on them. Another significant percentage, roughly 40-50%, or even 60%, involves adding pre-prepared visuals. Very few percentages, maybe less than 10% or even less than 5%, involve personal creations with some aesthetic and artistic elements included.”
          <br>
                        However, based on the author's observation of live recordings, this ratio is not fixed. Portraits and visuals creation can appear simultaneously at the Strawberry Music Festival. The main screen in the center displays visual creation, while two side screens broadcast portraits or the crowds.

                        <br>
                        • Market Saturation:
          <br>
                        There is a relatively high number of VJs in the market, while the demand of the VJs for music festivals is limited, leading to intense competition. Many VJs struggle to find sufficient resources and opportunities. For example, when author sought interview subjects, I found the VJ studio "looploop." However, the studio manager indicated that they had ceased operations, highlighting the difficulty of sourcing resources in the industry. Additionally, VJ-Tom mentioned, 'I wouldn't recommend newcomers to learn VJ because the current environment is challenging. If you don't have any performance resources, lack creative ability, and ideas, and you're just looking to earn a high salary, I wouldn't advise you to learn VJ. Even if you learn it, there's no guarantee you'll find a job.
          <br>
                        • Lack of Development Environment for Electronic Music
          <br>
                        The prosperity of the VJs industry is closely tied to electronic music. However, the development of electronic music festivals in China faces significant government constraints. There are substantial limitations on the approval of large event venues domestically. According to the “Regulations on the Safety Management of Large-scale Mass Activities”: “events with attendance ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 participants require approval from county-level public security agencies, while those with over 5,000 participants need approval from municipal or directly governed city public security agencies.”
          <br>
                        Moreover, when foreign DJs come to perform in China, there is also a scrutiny process for them. According to the “Notice on the Approval of Overseas Commercial Performances” : “it stipulates that the approval document for commercial performances must be verified through the 'Information System for Invitation Letter Management for Visa to China.” Failure to pass the verification process will result in the non-issuance of a visa.
          <br>VJ-Tom : “Firstly, the main issue domestically is the excessive restrictions. Even accessing the internet requires circumventing the Great Firewall. (Accessing YouTube in China requires using tools to bypass restrictions, such as a VPN, to watch videos.) The government's attitude toward electronic music is crucial. If there is effective promotion, the VJ industry would likely thrive. The challenge is that foreign DJs find it difficult to organize electronic music festivals in China, resulting in a shortage of quality resources. ”

                            Conceptually, audio visualization performances belong to the category of audio visualization interaction, which currently belongs to the field of digital media design in China.

To expand the ways of sensory experiences, designers integrate visual and auditory elements. This concept has gradually driven the progress of the audio visualization performances.(A summary based on the author's observations of digital media design in China)
          In terms of content, the most significant distinction between audio-visual interactive artists and conventional VJs lies in their emphasis on storytelling, profound thoughts, and expressive capabilities. Their works go beyond simple combinations of images and sounds; they represent a meaningful and profound artistic expression.
          Also, not all artists put money as a priority and don't want to be characterized and limited by commercial and market considerations. These artists aspire to have a leading role in their creative endeavors, and are more focused on expressing their own ideas and content.

                            Tracing the development of audiovisual interactive art in China, according to the "Audiovisual Art White Paper'' released by the School of Art Design and Media Department of East China University of Technology on November 29, 2023: "With the hosting of major international events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics and the 2010 Shanghai World Expo, along with advancements in network and computer technologies, audiovisual interactive art has rapidly emerged in China. Initially, in the Shanghai region[...]especially around 2010, when the Shanghai International Electronic Music Competition witnessed the emergence of audiovisual art. In 2015, the Ofopen Creative Coding Competition, jointly organized by Tsinghua University's Academy of Arts & Design[...] and Parsons School of Design in the United States, promoted the application of creative coding techniques in universities."

                            <br>
                            • Software Tools:
            <br>
                            Based on personal observations, Chinese students predominantly utilize Touch Designer and Processing when creating audiovisual interactive works. Professor Zhang Yinan introduced Touch Designer to Tongji University between 2011 and 2012, organizing workshops with the company over approximately a week's duration. The establishment of the

                            in 2019 contributed significantly to the widespread use of Touch Designer, providing substantial impetus to audiovisual interactive performances.
            <br>
                            • Art Forms:
            <br>
                            In terms of artistic exploration, the forms of new media art and installations abroad have sparked significant interest among Chinese artists. Some artists began experimenting with these forms around 2008, with a second and third wave of exploration occurring around 2012-2013. This suggests a gradual increase in the recognition of domestic artists towards new media and interactive art forms.
            <br>
                            • Universities Specialization:
            <br>
                            <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="* According to the author's understanding, these professions originally evolved from traditional graphic design, integrating with the latest emerging technologies.">

                            </span>
                            Terms such as "cross-media design" and "audiovisual design" are being introduced, incorporating the fusion of music and visual elements into the exploration domain. Major art academies in China are initiating specialized programs. As expressed by TonyMark, “Around 2015, these programs began to emerge gradually. Schools like Guangzhou Academy of Fine Arts had new media courses as early as the 2000s, but they were not given sufficient attention at the time. However, post 2018, these programs started to enroll large numbers of students, indicating a growing demand for expertise in this field, with students increasingly showing interest.”

                            Wang Meng handles the visual elements, while Yu Miao is responsible for the music. Yu Miao primarily performs using the traditional Chinese instrument, the Guzheng, exploring unconventional playing techniques to discover new possibilities.What sets these two apart from many other Chinese artists is their innovative approach, breaking away from directly replicating old traditional visuals and music.

His latest album explores the relationship between the online world and life. He describes it as, "Blending suitable styles like IDM, Techno, Ambient, etc., through synthesizer modulation and wild sample processing, I construct a seemingly parallel yet incredibly real otherworldly landscape. I insert a pair of virtual alter egos into this world to advance the plot."

                            According to his description below the video, the entire performance is an audiovisual instrument & sound-image isomorphic real-time show, facilitated by a digital instrument with only three tracks. Real-time scanning of images produces waveforms (wavetables), and the entire 360-degree circular screen serves as a sequencer and sound distorter. The sounds generated from images are irregular and texturally distinct, presenting pure and aggressively digital noise, accompanied by structurally complex polyrhythmic sequences, earning it the name "CROTALUS."

                            Wang Changcun is one of the earliest explorers in the field of experimental electronic music and computer-programmed composition in China. His long-term artistic practice is closely related to non-traditional art languages such as digital, network, and algorithm, often reflecting the dilemma of people's movement in established spaces through virtual structures.
            <br>
                            Wang Changcun's visual design, as described on his personal website, appears to collect images commonly seen in the online world, transforming them into a new visual format presented to the audience.

                                    It involves using facial recognition to replace faces in short videos with simple drawings.
                Screenshots 4-6 depict his distortion of chat records from the Chinese social app WeChat in the video, transforming the rectangular chat interface into a circular one that rotates.
                The last 3 screenshots simulate a computer interface, with the positions of folders and alert boxes constantly changing. Another interface is nested within the desktop window, suggesting that people are unable to escape the multitude of windows in the online world.

                            GOOOOOSE is Han Han. His multi-instrumental approach of making music usually leads the audience into a place where ambient soundscape, heavily synthesized texture and syncopated rhythms find their harmony, yet still fighting with each other sometimes. Apart from making music, Han Han is also a visual artist and software developer, also frontman of one of China’s electronica bands - Duck Fight Goose and owner of Miniless Recordings.

                            , performed by him in November 2023 at offscript x UFO Terminal at TankShanghai, serves as a visual extension of his album "Rudiments." In the process, a cluster of metallic-glossed lines intertwines, resembling a lifelike entity that pulsates with the rhythm of the music, almost as if it breathes.

                            <strong>Existing Issues:</strong>
                            <br>
                            • Limited Art Themes:
            <br>
                            Society often fails to fully appreciate, and sometimes even disregards, the normal demand for art. Artists often find themselves restricted to themes that are surface-level and avoid social pain points, constraining true creative expression. Especially post-pandemic, the highly regarded theme of "healing" in China has not triggered profound societal reflections but has evolved into a means to soothe emotions.(Doing art against the government in China will risk prison.)
            <br>
                            • Insufficient Financial Support:
            <br>
                            Domestically, there is inadequate support for artists, lacking dedicated mechanisms to provide funding and subsidies. Jimmz: "Actually, every year, organizing performances or exhibitions for the Light Art Festival(A digital media art festival organized by TEA) involves a financial investment. A significant portion of the funds from our other commercial projects is allocated to this."
            <br>
                            • Lack of Social Status:
            <br>
                            Artists lack sufficient recognition in society, with many viewing those studying design and art as symbols of poor academic performance or idleness, rather than individuals making career choices based on their interests.
            <br>
                            • Bias in Employment Choices:
            <br>
                            Even graduates from design and art colleges rarely enter the new media art industry. Employment decisions predominantly depend on salary and alignment with mainstream values, diminishing the importance of individual interests. This constrains exploration and support for more experimental and innovative fields of art.

                        Besides, in terms of real-time and improvisational aspects of VJ performances, nightclub VJs typically leverage pre-prepared visual elements, utilizing Resolume to make on-the-spot adjustments such as rotation, speed modulation, and distortion to synchronize with the musical performance of the DJ, demonstrating a degree of improvisation. In the context of music festivals, VJs, driven by considerations for stability and minimizing errors, often opt to play prepared materials, with seldom manifestations of real-time adjustments.
            <br>Within the artist community, some artists choose to directly play prepared materials to maintain a distinctive personal style. In contrast, other artists, such as Guan Boyang, adopt a production method that involves direct generation based on live sound, constituting live generation.

</div>
<p>
    This study provides an exploration of the current state of VJ development in China. Through chapters on nightclub VJs, festival VJs, and music visualization artists, it reveals that the development of VJ culture in China is still in its early stages. Despite certain issues such as emulation of popular foreign visual styles, a lack of individual reflection and innovation, and insufficient attention to copyright concerns, the future growth of VJ appears promising.
            <br>
    In the process of development, the VJ industry in China faces various challenges, including government restrictions, lagging education levels, and students' preferences in employment choices. In order to promote the better development of VJ, emphasis should be placed on the development of software and aesthetic education. Furthermore, VJs can seek international opportunities to foster exchange and learning.
            <br>
    While it may be challenging to alter governmental decisions, individuals can continuously enhance their personal skills and innovation capabilities, contributing to the advancement of their own development.
            <br>Beyond exploring the VJ profession, this study also intends to broaden the understanding of the future development direction of new media design in China. As a student in the field of media communication design, navigating the uncertainties of future career development is a profound challenge. Thus, by immersing myself in VJ research, I hope to gain a deeper practical understanding of media communication design and identify potential directions for my future works. Simultaneously, this research serves as a reference for fellow students who may be grappling with uncertainty about their future career paths.
